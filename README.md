# Clustering-on-shopping-data

- In this project, I performed clustering analysis on shopping data using both hierarchical clustering and agglomerative clustering techniques.

Hierarchical Clustering:

- I used the SciPy library to apply hierarchical clustering, generating a dendrogram to visualize the relationships between data points and the optimal number of clusters.

Agglomerative Clustering:

- I implemented Agglomerative Clustering using scikit-learn, which iteratively merges clusters based on distance metrics, allowing for flexible clustering of the shopping data.
